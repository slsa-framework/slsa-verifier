# Verification of SLSA provenance
This repository contains the implementation for verifying [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/). It currently supports verifying provenance generated by:
1. [SLSA generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator)
1. [Google Cloud Build (GCB)](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/view-build-provenance).

## Installation

You have two options to install the verifier.

### Compilation from source

#### Option 1: Install via go
```
$ go install github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/cli/slsa-verifier@v1.3.1
$ slsa-verifier <options>
```

#### Option 2: Compile manually
```
$ git clone git@github.com:slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.git
$ cd slsa-verifier && git checkout v1.3.1
$ go run ./cli/slsa-verifier <options>
```

### Download the binary

Download the binary from the latest release at [https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/releases/tag/v1.3.1](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/releases/tag/v1.3.1)

Download the [SHA256SUM.md](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/blob/main/SHA256SUM.md).

Verify the checksum:

```
$ sha256sum -c --strict SHA256SUM.md
  slsa-verifier-linux-amd64: OK
```

## Available options

We currently support artifact verification (for binary blobs) and container images.

## Option list

Below is a list of options currently supported for binary blobs and container images. Note that signature verification is handled seamlessly without the need for developers to manipulate public keys. See [Available options](#available-options) for details on the options exposed to validate the provenance.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.git
$ go run ./cli/slsa-verifier/ verify-artifact --help
Verifies SLSA provenance on an artifact blob

Usage:
  slsa-verifier verify-artifact [flags]

Flags:
      --build-workflow-input map[]    [optional] a workflow input provided by a user at trigger time in the format 'key=value'. (Only for 'workflow_dispatch' events). (default map[])
      --builder-id string             the unique builder ID who created the provenance
  -h, --help                          help for verify-artifact
      --print-provenance              print the verified provenance to stdout
      --provenance-path string        path to a provenance file
      --source-branch string          [optional] expected branch the binary was compiled from
      --source-tag string             [optional] expected tag the binary was compiled from
      --source-uri string             expected source repository that should have produced the binary, e.g. github.com/some/repo
      --source-versioned-tag string   [optional] expected version the binary was compiled from. Uses semantic version to match the tag
```

### Option details

The following options are available:

| Option | Description | Support
| --- | ----------- | --------
| `source-uri` | Expects a source, for e.g. `github.com/org/repo`. | All builders
| `source-branch` | Expects a `branch` like `main` or `dev`. Not supported for all GitHub Workflow triggers. | [GitHub builders](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator#generation-of-provenance)
| `source-tag` | Expects a  `tag` like `v0.0.1`. Verifies exact tag used to create the binary. Supported for new [tag](https://github.com/slsa-framework/example-package/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e.go.tag.main.config-ldflags-assets-tag.slsa3.yml#L5) and [release](https://github.com/slsa-framework/example-package/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e.go.release.main.config-ldflags-assets-tag.slsa3.yml) triggers. | [GitHub builders](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator#generation-of-provenance)
| `source-versioned-tag` | Like `tag`, but verifies using semantic versioning. | [GitHub builders](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator#generation-of-provenance)
| `build-workflow-input` | Expects key-value pairs like `key=value` to match against [inputs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_dispatchinputs) for GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch` triggers. | [GitHub builders](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator#generation-of-provenance)

## Verification for GitHub builders

### Artifacts

To verify an artifact, run the following command:

```bash
$ slsa-verifier verify-artifact slsa-test-linux-amd64 \
  --provenance-path slsa-test-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-test \
  --source-tag v1.0.3
Verified signature against tlog entry index 3189970 at URL: https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries/206071d5ca7a2346e4db4dcb19a648c7f13b4957e655f4382b735894059bd199
Verified build using builder https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/builder_go_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v1.2.0 at commit 5bb13ef508b2b8ded49f9264d7712f1316830d10
PASSED: Verified SLSA provenance
```

The verified in-toto statement may be written to stdout with the `--print-provenance` flag to pipe into policy engines.


### Containers
This is WIP and currently not supported.

## Verification for Google Cloud Build

### Artifacts
This is WIP and currently not supported.

### Containers
To verify a contaimer image, you need to pass a container image name that is _immutable_ by providing its digest, in order to avoid [TOCTOU attacks](#toctou-attacks).

Run the commands below:

```bash
$ IMAGE=laurentsimon/slsa-gcb-v0.3:test
```

Download the provenance:
```shell
$ gcloud artifacts docker images describe $IMAGE --format json --show-provenance > provenance.json
```

Get the digest for your container _without_ pulling it using the [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md) command:
```shell
$ IMAGE="${IMAGE}@"$(crane digest "${IMAGE}")
```

Verify the image:
```bash
$ slsa-verifier verify-image "$IMAGE" \
  --provenance-path provenance.json \
  --source-uri github.com/laurentsimon/gcb-tests \
  --builder-id=https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/GoogleHostedWorker

PASSED: Verified SLSA provenance
```

The verified in-toto statement may be written to stdout with the `--print-provenance` flag to pipe into policy engines.

## Technical design

### Specifications
For a more in-depth technical dive, read the [SPECIFICATIONS.md](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/SPECIFICATIONS.md).

### TOCTOU attacks
As explained on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use), a "time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) is a class of software bugs caused by a race condition involving the checking of the state of a part of a system and the use of the results of that check".

In the context of provenance verification, imagine you verify a container refered to via a _mutable_ image `image:tag`. The verification succeeds and verifies the corresponding hash is `sha256:abcdef...`. After verification, you pull and run the image using `docker run image:tag`. An attacker could have altered the image between the verification step and the run step. To mitigate this attack, we ask users to always pass an _immutable_ reference to the artifact they verify.
